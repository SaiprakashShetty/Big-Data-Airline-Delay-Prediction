# Big-Data---Airline-Delay-Prediction
Predicting US Airline Delay using spark(pyspark) and Apache Arrow. 
The objective of this project is to perform analysis on the historical flight data to gain valuable
insights and build a predictive model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not for a given set
of flight characteristics.
Questions to be answered post analysis:
• Which Airports have the Most Delays?
• Which Routes are typically the most delayed?
• Airport Origin delay per month
• Airport Origin delay per day/hour
• What are the primary causes for flight delays?
The objective of the predictive model(Logistic Regression) is to build a model to predict whether a
flight will be delayed or not based on certain characteristics of the flight. Such a model may help both
passengers as well as airline companies to predict future delays and minimize them for the future
references.
